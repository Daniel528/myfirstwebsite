			<h1>Clare's Story</h1>
			<p>
			Clare is one of the oldest members of the Greatest Grandkids community.  She first signed up with Greatest Grandkids in Sydney after the death of her husband Reginald.  Clare found that she was feeling lonely all the time with her other family in separate parts of Australia.  Clare first heard about Greatest Grandkids from her friend Denise in her unit complex and thought it would be a good way to keep her occupied.  She called up the Greatest Grandkids office and inquired about the service, she was told by a friendly consultant that they were having a bi annual BBQ at a local park to help welcome new members into the community.  Clare decided to go along with her friend Denise to the BBQ.  After spending the day with lots of different people both young and old Clare was assigned a young man named George and Denise put her name down to become a phone/pen pal.  George and Clare spend every second Sunday having lunch at Clare's house and every other Sunday spending time with George's family, whether it be at one of George's kid's sports games or just spending time with George's family around their house.  Clare and George were very pleased with the results of the Greatest Grandkids program and still spend time together even with Greatest Grandkids moving to Brisbane.

			<h1>Barbara's Story</h1>
			<p>
			Barbara is an active member in the Greatest Grandkids community and has been for many years.  Barbara first signed up for Greatest Grandkids when it was located in Sydney with a group of friends from her retirement village.  She and her friends all enjoyed each other's company but wanted to get out of the retirement village more often.  They all agreed to sign up for Greatest Grandkids and formed a large group of elderly people and volunteers who created their own group events for other members of the Greatest Grandkids community to attend like BBQ and game nights and also helped  a lot with the organization of events put on by the Greatest Grandkids office.  After a few years many of her friends a part of the program either moved away or passed on and Barbara started to focus her time with just her volunteer.  Her volunteer was a lady named Janet who worked at a local school.  To help Barbara get out of the retirement village more often, Janet would invite Barbara to work in the school kitchen with her, helping kids from all over the school with their cooking classes, she also would work for free in the canteen for kids at lunch.  Barbara still works with the school and visits Janet when she can even after the Greatest Grandkids office has moved to Brisbane and is a great example of what Greatest Grandkids stands for.
